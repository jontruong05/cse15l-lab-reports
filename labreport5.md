## EdStem Post: Index Out Of Bound Exceptions with Command Line Arguments

Student: I'm trying to write a program that prints out at most 3 arguments from the command line when I run `java File`. However, I'm getting some `IndexOutOfBoundExceptions`. I think the problem may be with the for loop, but I'm not sure what the problem exactly is. 

Here are screenshots of my file structure, my Java source code called `File.java`, and a bash script called `script.sh`:
